-------------------------- Data Structures & Variables-----------------------------------------

message : struct type
    buf -> stores the content of  message
    len -> stores length of content 
    flags -> stores flags provided by user

send_buffer : message ** type
    equivalent to Send_message table
    can stores a maximum of 10 messages

recv_buffer : message** type
    equivalent to Recv_message table
    can stores a maximum of 10 messages

NOTE : We have considerd this problem as equivalent to bounded buffer producer consumer problem.

send_count : int type
    stores no of messages currently in send table

recv_count : int type
    stores no of messages currently in recv table

send_in : int type
    stores the index in circular buffer where next element need to be inserted
